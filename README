The "Hack Day" Web App
======================

A friendly little website for helping your organization run a Hack Day event.
We aim to address:

    * participant registration
    * team creation and management
    * project memorialization (file upload)
    * communications
        * blog
        * twitter
        * facebook
        * email
    * staff-managed wiki
    * voting
    * site themes

The site is built on Django 1.3 and Python 2.7. We strive for PEP-8ness, clean
code, and test coverage.
